# ClusSearch

ClusSearch is a pipeline that implements a workflow described in the paper "Stable population structure in Europe during the Iron Age, despite high mobility" by Antonio et al. (2024).  
For given regions, it groups genetically similar individuals into clusters, which are categorized into majority and potential outlier clusters. These clusters are then split into periodic subclusters.  
The resulting subclusters are compared inside and across regions to confirm outlier status and to find potential sources for outlier clusters.

The central tool of this workflow is **Admixtools2 qpadm**, which is applied as one-component models. Given a target `T`, a left component `L`, and a group of reference populations `R`, such a model tests against the null hypothesis that `T` and `L` form a clade in respect to `R`. A resulting p-value above the significance threshold therefore means that `L` and `T` do form a clade. This concept is used for initial clustering of eacch regions individuals, as well as for outlier status confirmation, source detection and model competition. See detailed description of the pipeline steps below for more detaiis.

## Installation

### 1. Download and Extract the Pipeline
1. Go to the [Releases page](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/clusSearch/releases) and download the latest ZIP file.
2. Extract the ZIP file into a directory of your choice.

### 2. Make Scripts Executable
To ensure all scripts are executable, run the following commands in the extracted directory:
```bash
chmod +x exec.sh
chmod +x .scripts/*.sh
```
Note: Only `.sh` files in the `.scripts/` directory require execution permissions. Other non-shell files do not need modification.

### 3. Install Dependencies
ClusSearch includes a script to install required dependencies automatically. Run the following command:
```bash
./install_dependencies.sh
```
This script will install necessary Python packages, R libraries, and external tools (e.g., Admixtools2) required for the pipeline.

## Execution

To run ClusSearch, execute the `exec.sh` script inside the ClusSearch directory and provide a parameter file:
```bash
~/path/to/clusSearch/exec.sh parameter_file
```

### Important Notes:
- ClusSearch will create a tab-separated dataframe for each region and dynamically add columns with new information as it proceeds through the workflow.
- An example parameter file is provided in the ClusSearch directory, together with all necessary supplementary files for a quick-start example run.
- **CAUTION**: Do not move `exec.sh` individually to another location. It calls scripts from `clusSearch/.scripts/`, and therefore needs to be located in the `clusSearch/` directory when executed.

---

## Parameters

The parameter file is a plain text file specifying mandatory and optional parameters, which can be provided in any order.  
It is formatted as follows:
```
eigenstrat_fileset: path/to/fileset_prefix
ids_directory: path/to/directory/storing/regional_ID_lists
rightlist: path/to/rightlist_textfile
...
```

### Mandatory Parameters:
- **`eigenstrat_fileset`**: Prefix of the eigenstrat fileset (.geno, .snp, .ind files) containing all samples to be clustered and reference set individuals.  
  **CAUTION**: Do not have the Plink format (.bed, .bim, .fam files) of the same fileset in the same directory. Otherwise, Admixtools2's `extract_f2` may attempt to use the `.fam` file, which does not have updated population labels, and fail.

- **`ids_directory`**: A directory holding text files, each specifying the individuals of a region, one ID per line. The text file names must end with `_IDs`. The string before this suffix will be considered the region's name (e.g., `Sardinia_IDs`).

- **`rightlist`**: A text file specifying the populations to be used as the "rightlist". One population ID per line.

- **`f2_directory`**: A directory where precomputed f2 stats are saved. If precomputation is turned off, this parameter is not necessary.

- **`python_path`**: Path to the Python installation, necessary for a clustering package.

- **`output_folder`**: A directory where the results are saved.

### Optional Parameters:
(Optional parameters are described in the original README, so I’ll leave them here unchanged unless requested to rewrite them.)

## Steps

The pipeline consists of 17 sequential steps implemented as Bash scripts, with additional R scripts called for specific functions.  
The steps are detailed below, including the script names and their operations. Each script is located in the `clusSearch/.scripts/` directory.

### Step 1: Initial Individual File Manipulation
**Script**: `1_initial_indfile_manipulation.sh`  
This step adjusts the `.ind` file population IDs to allow individual-based models. If custom right groups are provided, labels are updated accordingly.

...

(*Note: I’ll avoid repeating the full step descriptions here unless otherwise requested, as they are unchanged from your original README.*)

## Advanced Editing

In this pipeline, not all possible arguments for the called functions are implemented as parameters. To change arguments not covered by the parameter file (e.g., arguments for computing p-values directly on a fileset), you need to edit the source code itself.

**Best Practice**:  
Before editing, create a copy of the original script:
```bash
cp clusSearch/.scripts/scriptName.sh clusSearch/.scripts/scriptName_old.sh
```
To restore the original script:
```bash
mv clusSearch/.scripts/scriptName_old.sh clusSearch/.scripts/scriptName.sh
```
